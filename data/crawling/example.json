       "content":"Dear students,\nThank you for taking CS410 and welcome to CS410 Campuswire!\nAs requested by the university, we will no longer use Piazza for our classes as we used to, but instead use Campuswire this semester.  Those of you who have used Piazza will find Campuswire to be essentially similar to Piazza.  We will use Campuswire for all the  announcements and discussions of issues related to the class. It also serves as the major platform for question answering. So please make sure that you are regularly on Campuswire. For important announcements posted on Campuswire, we will also send you an email notification.\nI have eight excellent TAs to assist me in teaching this online class. They are:\n1. Assma Boughoula  (Head TA, boughou1@illinois.edu)\n2. Kevin Ros (Special TA: Infrastructure Coordinator, kjros2@illinois.edu)\n3. Yuxiang Liu (yuxiang@illinois.edu)\n4. Richa Meherwal (meherwa2@illinois.edu)\n5. Junting Wang (junting3@illinois.edu)\n6. Ziyuan Wei (ziyuan3@illinois.edu)\n7. Yuchen Yan (yucheny5@illinois.edu)\n8. Yunan Zhang (yunanz2@illinois.edu)\nI want to use this opportunity to thank all of them for serving as the TAs for this class. Special thanks to Assma for serving as the Head TA to coordinate all the TA work and to Kevin as our Special TA for taking care of two key infrastructures for supporting programming assignments and course projects!\nThis is our first post on Campuswire. We will post more information about the course here soon. Meanwhile, please feel free to post any questions that you may have here and we will do our best to answer your questions as soon as we can.  We believe that collaborative learning is powerful and beneficial, so we strongly encourage all of you to share your expertise and help answer questions from each other if you can.\nHope you will enjoy this online class. The TAs and I  are looking forward to working with all of you!\nThanks,\nChengXiang (\"Cheng\") Zhai, Instructor of CS410\nEmail: czhai@illinois.edu",

The course will provide information about graduate student policies and procedures pertaining to the Online MCS/MCS-DS program as well as general University resources to ensure your success in the program. It will also allow you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Coursera degree portal prior to beginning your coursework towards degree requirements. Please block off some time to complete this Onboarding Course.\n100% completion of the Onboarding Course is required in order to access your classes on the platform.",

LOL.. SO BE PREPARED FOR THAT !!\nRegarding Notes taking... I feel its personal.. But I use a MS One Note and rather than noting down the text... I take screenshots of all the important sections of the Slides while studying and arrange them Week and topic wise. This has helped for studying for the exams.. So i don't have to refer to the the Slides again....\nHere is an example of how I write my notes...",
