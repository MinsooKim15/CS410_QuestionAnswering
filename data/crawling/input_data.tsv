"I can see that about 176 students have not yet been enrolled on Coursera. I'll see what's going on.

10	post_7	Coursera	Should I be able to see this class on Coursera? I have a section that says Illinois Campus, but the only thing there is an onboarding course?	You will only see this class once you finish the onboarding course. It will appear after several hours! Hope this helps!
11	post_7	Coursera	Should I be able to see this class on Coursera? I have a section that says Illinois Campus, but the only thing there is an onboarding course?	According to MCS Onboarding Course instructions (make sure you complete it before you can have access to this course on Coursera), once you registered this class at the University Student Self-Service you should be automatically added to Coursera on day 1 of this semester. I would recommend first check if you registered the correct CRN (should be 67393 for online MCS section) and then check with Coursera..
12	post_7	Coursera	Should I be able to see this class on Coursera? I have a section that says Illinois Campus, but the only thing there is an onboarding course?	One other thing to check: have you completed the onboarding course? Regular courses probably would not show up until that point.

Tech Review (for 4-credit students). It will require you to generate a short 1-2 page review on an interesting course-related cutting-edge technology topic not covered in any lecture.
What is the significance on mentioning for 4-credit students in the bracket ? Is this an optional activity for some students ?"	"Students that are registered for this course are either in a 3 or 4 credit hour section. I believe the that graduate students (those who are either enrolled in an online MCS or on-campus MS/MCS) are registered for the 4 credit hour sections, whereas undergrads register for the 3 hour section.
Tech review is required for students in the 4 hour section, but is not required for students in the 3 hour section."

36	post_19	What does the professor mean when he says grades based on completion?	I was watching the introductory video for the class and the professor said the grade will be based on completion. Can someone please tell me which assignments will be based off completion and what assignments are based on grades or otherwise?	"It means that if you have completed the assignment task satisfactorily (i.e., satisfying all the specified basic requirements), you will receive full points for the assignment. The ""basic requirements"" will be specified very clearly and can often be satisfied if sufficient effort is made (e.g., a minimum length for a report)."

We hope to complete the setup ASAP and will post a note here once it's available. You don't need to do anything for now.  LiveDataLab is used for MPs, and the hard deadline for MP1 is sometime in Oct.

45	post_25	MP1 -Which is the correct Due Date and how different it is from Hard Deadline?	"Hi TAs and Professor,
I am seeing the Due Date for MP1 as Sep 5th under the Grade section.
But, when I go to Week2 -> Programming Assignment 1 ->  MP1, it says in Coursera-
You should complete MP1 by Sunday, September 13 2020, 11:59pm (CDT).
At the same time, in Week1 -> Course Deadlines, Late Policies, and Academic Calendar, it says:
Wanted to know which Due Dates should we be following in future and how our grades would be affected in case we miss the first Due Date for submission. Thank you."	"Thanks for your question! We have just updated the deadlines. Please also check information in the orientation part.
For MPs, if you finish after the due time but before the hard deadlines, you will receive 50% of points. If later than hard deadlines, you would get no points."

"I saw the below info in ""Late Policy"" section in ""Course Deadlines, Late Policies, and Academic Calendar"". Should be useful for your info.
""MPs submitted after the due date and before the hard deadline will receive a 50% penalty.""
""The hard deadline is the deadline after which you will receive 0 points on assignments"""

If I understand, the Due Date column is recommended date to complete the assignment and wont be any penalty if you miss the Due Date (that is more like a soft deadline to keep you go with the pace). The Hard Deadline is what I believe they expect you to complete the assignment for sure.

Tony"	"Course introduction video doesn't say anything about open book exams and also from previous students I never heard exams are open book. So I would conclude proctored exams aren't open book.
Regarding notes, each student has their own style of doing things. Do as you feel comfortable for your learning. Although you can download the lecture videos and go through them even when you are offline."

As for the release dates, please hang tight. We are still in the process of finalizing the submission infrastructure and course project topics, and will send an update once everything is ready."
57	post_30	Simplest VSM and Bloom Filter	"I noticed that they are somewhat similar: both use bit vector, both use hash functions, and both could produce false positives but no false negatives (well, in case of VSM, false positive would mean less relevant document being ranked higher, and false negative would mean relevant document being ranked lower).
Is one inspired by another?"	"I think bloom filters are great for space optimization and for a quick 'not of interest' filter, because as you said, they can get false positives but not false negatives.
I am also curious how locality sensitive hashing relates to text retrieval and VSM"

84	post_50	Will office hours be recorded?	Previous courses I've taken have provided recordings of office hours for students who are not able to make them to review later. Will this course also record office hours or will they only be live?	Yes, our office hours will be recorded and the videos will be available to you later.

I searched solutions online using a personal access token. I also updated the keychain password with the token but still got this error. Did anyone have saw the same issue and fix it?"	I got this message when I entered CLI commands and found out that github has moved from password to personal tokens.  I set up a personal token from setup:developer settings: personal settings.  This fixed it for me.

88	post_60	Does anyone know if we can take the exams early?	I may be out of the country the week of the second exam. Is it something I can take a week early? I haven't seen anything written, so this may be a question for the professor/ TAs.	Exams will have a window of a few days (4 to 5 days) in which you can take it. If you have a legitimate excuse or conflict with all exam window dates, they we can work together so you can reschedule and take your exam later after the main exam window (not before!!)

I have friends enrolled in T11 sessions, and I wanted to see if it is possible for us to study for quizzes/exams together and helping each other on assignments.	"Yes! all sections of CS410 are very very similar. No change in material taught, or assignments at all. You will work on the same MPs and Project milestones, and submit your work in exactly the same way too. The only difference is between students taking the class for 3 credits and those taking the class for 4 credits. 4 credit students must complete the ""Tech Review"" while 3 credit students don't."
93	post_64	MP setup	I have tried my access token as password but I still can't make it, may anyone help?	We are still testing all the MPs, so  you can wait until we finish testing MP1 to start working on it. Since other students didn't seem to have the same problem, I suspect it has to do with your computing environment (e.g., using a Mac vs. a Windows system).  Maybe you can share more information about what OS you are using.
94	post_64	MP setup	I have tried my access token as password but I still can't make it, may anyone help?	You can give it a try to check your keychain setup step if you are using macOS. I fixed it after changing the default value for Account and Where.

I don't believe (someone can correct me if I'm wrong) that it has to be the same token as the one to set up LiveDataLab. One is to authenticate to the service, but the other can just be used between your terminal and github."

109	post_78	Maximum size of group	Hi, I wonder what is the maximum size for the project group?	We originally thought that the maximum size is 3, but given that some of you requested to have a larger group size and we in general encourage you to collaborate with your peers to finish a more impactful project than what you could do with yourself, we have just decided to increase the maximum size to 5. We will update any relevant Coursera pages to reflect this change soon.
110	post_78	Maximum size of group	Hi, I wonder what is the maximum size for the project group?	I guess it is 3 and if more than 3 you have to take instructor approval and the project should be such that you can easily divide work without too much coordination among so many members.

If you don't know about this concept, please don't worry about it, though I think Bill Guo has given an excellent explanation of it!  In case it's a test quiz question, please do let us know.

126	post_94	Group Size Scaling	Is the scope of the project expected to match the number of members of the group? For example, would someone working alone be expected to have a smaller project than a group of 5?	Yes that is correct. Having said that, 1 person teams are highly discouraged. Please try to find a group of students to work together on the project. The quality of work from multi-person teams is always much better (1+1 > 2 kinda thing). If you can't find a team after looking seriously for a while, then 1 person teams are allowed in that case.

In #88, Bill posted excellent explanation on what's the Cosine similarity and L2 distance.
But not sure why Cosine similarity is better than L2 distance. Many thanks for any sharings."	"I think both can be used but dot multiplication makes the calculation easier.
In N-dimensional space, document vector d = [1, 1, 1, ..., 1]. Query vector, for example, q = [1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. With dot multiplication, all dimensions will be cancelled out by 0 except the first one.

Is the answer be that the min IDF value would be represented by log((M+1)/M)? Such that as the number of documents in a collection increases and they all contain the term W, the IDF value would approach 0?	I think your understanding is right and logically if you think a particular word is so common that it does not make any sense to include that in ranking function. In other words, the term is irrelevant from point of view of ranking.

Double check your webhook configuration , the URL and content-type needs to be set properly with Push notification turned on . Once the pipeline works properly, you should be able to see leaderboard ( I'm hoping so )

"Confidence scores are usually tricky imo. You can look at the concept of calibration (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/270508/meaning-of-model-calibration).
Sometimes even for seemingly high performing models,  the model tends to misclassify with a very high confidence. This is a classic example of a poorly calibrated model. I believe your logic should stand, given some careful additional checks are performed for the validity of the confidence scores."

I assume you are referring to the u' prefix. The u' prefix basically indicates that the string is a unicode string. You can refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2464959/whats-the-u-prefix-in-a-python-string."

Is there some ambiguity in the answer or am I missing something?
Please help.
Thanks!"	"IDF is given by the formula
log ((M + 1) / df (W))
M is total no. of documents in collection
df(W) is total no. of docs containing the word W
In case of stop words df(W) is high therefore IDF is lower.
Also, stop words will occupy lot of space in the inverted index. We do not include stop words in processing because they are not relevant for search and this saves space and also improves performance."

We will have a list of project topics that you could choose from and we will also provide relevant papers there. You could start your tech review before your project.

Kautuk"	The encodings are different because unary encoding is defined differently in slides and in the textbook, I guess. Check out #269 for a more general definition of the Gamma code. In that definition, if you flip the bits of the Unary code part, you will get encodings like they are in the textbook. I guess both are acceptable forms of representation in the Unary code. The instructor/TA can clarify if the one used in the slides will be the one we will follow in the rest of the course.

You can go to any extractor/decompressor and just copy the contents of the compressed folder to the location of your python script. You don't necessarily need to run tar within your python script.

2nd part is 001 = 5-2^floor(log 5) (base 2)=1 = 01 in binary.
why is 1= 01 in binary in this example and not 001 like in the first example?"	"From the slide, floor(log(5))  = 2, so two bits are required.
Note this log() is using a base as 2.
From a different way, as 5 = 2 ^ 2 (this 2 decides the bits for the 1) + 1, the last 1 should use two bits, so 01."

If i understand correctly you can do it anywhere you run python so the terminal, pycharm, spyder, jupyter notbooks... Im planning to use jupyter notebooks what about everyone else?	Jupyter notebook is good but I personally prefer pycharm mostly because I like IntelliJ products as IDE

"I used Sublime Text for .py files and Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration.
I also tried using Pycharm for .py files. But it didn't support Python 3.5, so I had to switch to Sublime.
Wondering if VS Code will be better than Sublime Text for .py editing."

Python shell, ipython, or JupyterLab/notebook for interactive exploration and testing so I can pause intermediate states (ex: see how token object returns different values with different parameters).

You can use any one which you feel confident to get the MPs done. Just be aware that there is specific version requirements for the MPs. For e.g. MP1 metapy wont run on any python but 2.7 or 3.5.

MP 2.1 cautions that our bio_urls.txt submissions should have minimal overlap with bio_urls from other students and terms. How can we check this? Faculty can have multiple appointments across departments, and I want to avoid overlapping too much with other projects that used the same university.	"Ideal solution will be to select a university not listed in the sheet.

Also, the selected university should have academic faculty page and also link to a page with information about each faculty."

I am a little confused. Why the first choice is correct but the third choice is not correct? Thank you very much!	I think in case of unigram model we assume that probability of each of the term is independent of  other. Since both are independent they are product of each other.

If you're running the function as it is defined in the sample folder, you will need to change the logic within the function to fit how your chosen faculty website is rendered.

Thanks."	"What we need is Recall to be higher compare to precision.
when BETA = 0 in F-Measure
F0 = Precision
when BETA = 1 in F-Measure

If the precision is high then the value after multiplication will be higher which will give high geometric mean.	"practice quiz spoiler
This was one of the notes in the practice quiz
so, my understanding is even though the system scored average precision of 0.9 on queryA and 0.01 on queryB (difficult  query ) the MAP would be (0.9+0.01)/2=0.455 but the gMAP=0.094 favouring the tougher query."

In such scenario, we hope to caught the relevant posts as many as possible, right? Which is to say that the measure of recall in F-measure should be attached more importance. Also, I am thinking why higher beta could bring more weights to recall, any explanations would be appreciated. (I plugged in some numbers into the F-measure formula to confirm with my guess)."	I explained it in 531 as link given in an answer below, but the simple explanation is that precision*recall/precision+recall - which is a simplification of formula - when precision goes higher the sum (in denominator) goes towards it - thus the division would cancel out precision/precision leaving recall - on the other hand if recall goes higher the sum would be closer to it, thus cancelling recall/recall in the formula.

In fact if you follow an example in the bio.txt you would see a para containing everything including the link texts. Now I am not saying that you can’t do it, but it should be up to you.

In the sample that has been provided, it shows that we have to get the data from the main section of the HTML content so that it only takes the necessary info.

You don't have to write a new function to iterate each term. As Ujjal said,score_one() will be called by ranker.score(). This is becauseInL2Ranker inherits from its parent class metapy.index.RankingFunction. The score() method, which iterates all terms using score_one() has been defined in the parent class. In the MP, the new defined score_one() overrides the score_one() of the parent class, but the score() method of the parent class remains unchanged and can still be used.

The ranking.score() calls the score_one() internally and you don't have to change any logic flow in the main section per se or worry about calling with list of terms. The ranking.score()  function takes care of the summation for you.

"MP 2.2 asks us to optimize a different ranker than BM25+k3, but the ""Statistical significance testing"" section asks us to compare InL2 to an optimized BM25. Is this just for illustration purposes, or do we really need to use BM25?"	For the submission of the first part you need to build your own ranker which is InL2 custom function where you need to write the equivalence of the formula given. The BM25 comparison is for the second part where you need to get the average using your ranker you built before and then get the average using BM25, write it to 2 different files (your ranker average in one file and BM25 to another) and then print the difference from the 2 files in significance.txt.

Has anyone given thought to making a randomized ranking function for use in this sort of null hypothesis testing?	Typically you want to reject a null hypothesis to prove your alternate hypothesis is better than it. It's not very meaningful to pick a too weak null hypothesis as the baseline(e.g. the random ranker), comparing to selecting a robust, effective ranker like BM25.

As per the content , its mainly user clicks on certain document is marked as relevant but I do not completely agree on this .

"I think it's past the assignment's due date now, but I handled this by moving the all the code that uses scripy including the import statement to the very bottom of the .py file. That way the grader application is able to run everything that matters and, even though it technically errors once it reaches the import at the bottom, it doesn't matter because it's already done its job.
Alternatively, you could have wrapped the scripy stuff in a try."
1111	post_823	MP2.2 ImportError: No module named scipy.stats	When I push to github, I got this error in Livelab. Are we not supposed to use any additional modules?	You need not post the scipy bit to github. You can write the logic for the significance test outside of the main script. This way you're not adding extra dependencies.
1112	post_823	MP2.2 ImportError: No module named scipy.stats	When I push to github, I got this error in Livelab. Are we not supposed to use any additional modules?	how you generated the significance value using scipy.stats need not to be included in the main code. That scipy code is considered a test code. Keep the file significance.txt file and that should be it.

Seems like something which can be used in case we want to consider only selective queries from the query_file (going by enumerate) - in our case, I think we are considering all of the queries. query_num could be a selector, while query_start is just to position it relatively.

I still see 100% credit in coursera. Does that mean I will get full credit?"	"If your coursera grade section shows 100% you already got the credit.
For extra credit which I think they will calculate and end of hard deadline, only the top 50 ranked candidate with 1 as score will be eligible for the extra credit.
So for extra credit success 1 along with top 50, both are required."

Should the rank be based on Overall Score ?
Rank in the leader board is  based on NDCG@10 of APNews and not on overall score. This doesn't seems correct."	Agree,. This doesn't appears as true ranking system as it should be based on overall score and success attempts only. The current view appears to be based only on APNews Score. I already sent a private post to the Instructors and TAs letting them know about this. I can update here once I get a response from them.

No! Parameter tuning is not about randomly selecting parameters. You should explore the parameter space in a more sophisticated manner, e.g., formulate an optimization problem or perform a brute-force or Monte Carlo search. Also, you are free to implement any ranking function on your own or use the (combination of) built-in ones in metapy."

1234	post_923	MP2.4 learning?	What exactly is the learning from MP2.4? Is it just a hit or miss while randomly changing the parameter or is there a way to think about this problem?	I agree with the sentiment here. Is this how the tweaking is done in the real world, or are there libraries that are built to optimize this? I considered writing a test driver script that would run through intervals of k1, b, and k3 and check the results, but I didn't have time. Maybe later. There has to be systems that do this!
1235	post_923	MP2.4 learning?	What exactly is the learning from MP2.4? Is it just a hit or miss while randomly changing the parameter or is there a way to think about this problem?	I think main learning is how to tune parameters of various models to achieve better search results. You could also improve existing models to improve the performance.

1238	post_930	MP2.4 fine-tune parameter	What options can we use for fine-tune various parameter settings?	"""...please make sure you do not overfit"" - just wondering if this comment is generalizable across data sets.

1239	post_930	MP2.4 fine-tune parameter	What options can we use for fine-tune various parameter settings?	I think it has to deal with the value ranges for the 3 parameters BM25 takes. For example for the k parameter value, it can go to positive infinity compared to the other parameters like b. So you cannot have the k value in same range as b. Ideally k is a way higher value range than b. Objective of this exercise is to familiarize us to those ranges I believe.
1240	post_930	MP2.4 fine-tune parameter	What options can we use for fine-tune various parameter settings?	The problem with overfitting is that while your numbers might go up for the cranfield set, they might perform very poorly with other sets. if they lead to overfitting for all 3 (thus maximizing all 3 results), I would think thats the good news :-) at least in the given context.
1241	post_930	MP2.4 fine-tune parameter	What options can we use for fine-tune various parameter settings?	Actually endless possibilities for fine tuning the parameters for any Ranker you chose. If you go through the ranker implementation and make yourself aware of the boundary values and how they impact the score then it might help you to fine tune better.

What are the advantages of using the Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine measure as a user similarity measure in collaborative filtering?	Cosine looks at similar user and the ratings they have given to the item - it is easier to calculate and you dont normalize the ratings given by users (for example, a user which rates everything 5 is the same as one which rates only few movies 5), as long as ratings on similar items are same.

What are the advantages of using the Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine measure as a user similarity measure in collaborative filtering?	"These are just two similarity measures one can use to measure the similarity between two users.
Here's a naive example:
When you hop on to your favorite online shopping website, the system will check how likely you are going to like say, a lego set, based on the choices of top 3 (or any k) similar users to you. How do we quantify this similarity? By using either the cosine measure or pearson correlation coefficient."

It depends on how you define longer formulas. Exam1 should be as easy as freshman-level statistic courses and discrete math courses. If you understand how the formula works, you would know how changes in input would affect the output, and how to plug in numbers for simple cases."

It's been stated that stemming technique improves recall but sometimes it may decrease precision . I do understand that that when we club a few similar words into one, recall can improve but in what situation precision can decrease?"	"Please see a very good explanation at wikipedia.
Stemming may result in two words being classified with the same stem that may not be related. One e.g. for Porter stemmer stems ""universal"", ""university"", and ""universe"" to ""univers"". This is a case of overstemming. This will result in losing precision at the cost of recall. If our search is for university even the documents with universe will be returned, reducing precision."

Zipf's law implies most words have small probabilities. If Zipf's law doesn't hold, it implies that many words have higher probabilities, so the number of documents containing each words will be higher. This implies that the number of documents in each posting file will increase as well. Hence, the inverted index would be much slower for lookup because there are more document IDs in the posting file to read.

If system A has higher precision at k document than system B for any number of k, does it mean A also has higher recall than B at any position?
Why is the answer to this yes?"	Precision is higher for every k means that ratio of no. of relevant documents to total no. of retrieved doc is always higher. This means no. of rejected documents is always lower for a given no. of retrieved documents. Therefore, recall is always higher for A.

Think of all additions like TF and IDF as an extra heuristic over the base formula: the dot product, which has two components:

on other hand,

w1 present in 1000 documents. and w2 present in 100 documents.
For the best possible case, which ever term having highest number of doc count (in this case w1 document count 1000) will contains all the w2 also. so 100 documents from w2  is part of those 1000 docs too."

""minimum"" implies that this is best case i.e. the other word always appears in some of these 1000 documents, and we dont need more accumulators.
The ""maximum"" i.e. worst case would be that all 100 instances of the other word appear in separate documents (mutually exclusive from the previous 1000 ones), leading to 1000+100 = 1100 accumulators."

"The assumption is that there are only 9 documents that are rated ""3"" in the collection, so the Ideal DCG @ 10 for that collection can't have 10 ""3""s, so assigning a ""2"" to the 10th document in the ideal case is the most optimal scenario given the assumption.

A higher parameter value gives more weight to the recall: this is because if we increase Beta, intuitively the coefficient of P in denominator will increase leading to overall decrease in effect of P over the final value.

p(w2=1) and 0.25 for p(w1=1,w2=1)?"	"Pseudo segments are added to mimic all possible combinations so as to avoid zero probability. In this case 4 pseudo segments each carrying weight of 0.25.
w1=0, w2=0
w1=1,w2=0
w1=0,w2=1
w1=1,w2=1
There are 2 pseudo segments for w1=1. Hence 0.5 got added ( 0.25 + 0.25 ).
There is only 1 pseudo segment with (w1=1,w2=1). Hence 0.25 added."

After the first 0, you find 3 bits 010, which leads to 2.
so the total is: 2 ^ 3 + 2 = 10
Also, list some examples for you to know more
9 = 8 + 1 = 2 ^ 3 + 1
so 3 1s + 0 + 001
so 111 0 001
10 = 8 + 2 = 2 ^ 3 + 2
so 3 1s + 0 + 010
so 111 0 010
Generally, 2 ^ x + y
x 1s + 0 + binary of y using x bits"

we couldn't reach disconnected pages.
once we get to a page with zero outlinks, we're stuck there (there's nowhere else to go).

"Alpha, Beta and Gammae --> they control the MOVEMENT of final Query vector along the Original Quwry, RELEVANT and NON-RELVANT centroids,respectively..
Alpha --> just factors up the original vector
If Beta is smaller then the new Query will be LESS closer to the RELEVANT centroid. as that component is ADDED.
and No, Gamma should not be Larger as it will SUBTRACT more from the original query vector..
centroid -> cluster of docs (relevant or non - relevant)"
1566	post_1164	Parameter in Rocchio's method	I know pseudo feedback is less reliable. But I still have no idea why beta should be smaller. Also, what about gamma? Should it be larger?	The lecture says that you should not give more importance to the algorithm (adjustment of scores) to what the user intended to look for (what he typed query wise). A large value of beta would override what the user types in as keywords. For gamma, it should be less (or 0) since negative feedback pulls you in all directions, thus creating not totally useful distraction (as per the lecture).
1567	post_1166	Pagerank score	How to get the Pagerank score?	You can think of it by using the Pagerank examples with links pic in the slide. So each node(among N nodes) will point to every other node and will have all other nodes pointing to itself. This means the transition matrix will be a uniform matrix with each node having a 1/N value as sum of each row would equal to 1.
1568	post_1166	Pagerank score	How to get the Pagerank score?	The probability (pagerank) should add up to 1 (N/N). if all the pages are same, then I would think they have equal probability -thus 1/N

Avoid the borderline and give yourself the unexpected troubleshooting window too. Many classmates spent upto 60 mins in the setup process.
1570	post_1167	Exam Time	if the exam is available until 10pm and the duration is an hour. Can I take my exam at 9:50 and get a full hour to finish?	I agree with Kushagra.

If you really want to do it though, you could check if 9:50 is even an available time slot in ProctorU

1573	post_1167	Exam Time	if the exam is available until 10pm and the duration is an hour. Can I take my exam at 9:50 and get a full hour to finish?	"I think it's fair to say that it's not worth it from a risk-benefit analysis perspective.
The relatively little gain through an extra hour or two of studying is not worth the dire consequence of failing to complete the exam -- imagine how much stress and regret you would feel.
Like the others said, with proctoru, it's not so rare to encounter issues/delays.  So it would be wise to leave some slack time.
Good luck!"

The versions can be printed to confirm that.

Design a model that can potentially ""generate"" the piece of text.

I finally passed the auto-grader. So for my MP3, the self.likelihoods = [ ] is a list where I appended the likelihoods of each document (I calculated the likelihood for each doc first), the final likelihood which we used to compare in the iteration is only one variable (the collection likelihood which is the sum of likelihoods of all docs).

You get the likelihood of each word in each document, and sum then to get the likelihood of each document in total, and finally sum all to get one value. You may refer the formula in Slide 7 below.

The likelihood should be of one dimension at last. You will get a double number, and will converges to a fixed value. When it becomes stable (see one parameter delta like 0.001) , the iteration is supposed to stop. Or you have looped enough n times depends on which condition meets first.

# Randomly initialize the matrices: document_topic_prob and topic_word_prob
I get the intuition for what these should be, however I don't understand why it is asking for these numbers to be initialized as a matrix.
How can I determine where to fill in the columns and rows, as opposed to just returning scalar values for both?"	"When you say scalar values, do you mean just one value for each instead of using a matrix? Since there are multiple documents, words, and topics, matrices are needed to keep track of all the probabilities. I'd suggest reading the lecture slides again and looking over the explanation in the git repo.
And about where to fill in the values, you can just use the np random function to get a matrix, and then normalize so the values sum to 1."

I was wondering what is the use case of the epsilon parameter? (thank you in advance)"	"It is used to check your likehood converge or not.
If you are not sure, check the mathematics limit concept.
Basically, your EM iteration stops when n meet the maximum limit, or the diff is less than epsilon"
1722	post_1342	MP3 what is the use of the epsilon param	"Hi,
I was wondering what is the use case of the epsilon parameter? (thank you in advance)"	Each step of EM will improve the likelihood. At one point the improvement between step n and step n+1 will be negligible. Negligible in our case means the likelihood(n+1) - likelihood (n) < epsilon.
1723	post_1342	MP3 what is the use of the epsilon param	"Hi,
I was wondering what is the use case of the epsilon parameter? (thank you in advance)"	epsilon is used as a threshold for likelihood delta for each iteration. once the delta is smaller than epsilon, your algo should exit.
1724	post_1342	MP3 what is the use of the epsilon param	"Hi,
I was wondering what is the use case of the epsilon parameter? (thank you in advance)"	Let us say that if you have a list storing likelihood for each iteration. The list is like [l1,l2,l3,...,l27,l28,l29]. Normally the gap between the likelihood(like l2-l1, l3-l2, l4-l3) will get smaller and smaller. For example, if you found l28-l27 > epsilon but l29 - l28 < epsilon(the first time the gap is less than epsilon) , that is the time to stop your iteration(since the improvement is so small)
1725	post_1342	MP3 what is the use of the epsilon param	"Hi,
I was wondering what is the use case of the epsilon parameter? (thank you in advance)"	Every iteration improves your likelihood a little bit. When the improvement is so small (smaller than epsilon), you would like to stop running the algorithm and take the current best model.

Is there any value to submitting a partial implementation to validate a subset of the implementation? i.e. does the autograder test just plsa() or does it also test the earlier implemented methods?"	"Yes it is for testing purposes only and also for manual debugging. You can create a copy of test.txt and remove those 0 and 1 too.
Since you have privilege of submitting unlimited times, anything you want to check with the autograder you can add print statements and run in autograder. But developing it locally will be much faster. In autograder submission, you can see your prints in the console output section."

The notation is confusing and I don't feel it is explained in a very straightforward way	The general understanding of this p is the probability of word w is generated from a topic k among a set of topics. For this formula, the numerator is the probability of word w generated from topic k, the denominator the sum of probabilities that word w is generated from different topics.
1748	post_1386	E-Step Equation Explanation	Can anyone explain what is happening in the denominator? The notation is confusing and I don't feel it is explained in a very straightforward way	"We are normalizing the value (probability) that was calculated in numerator, by dividing with the sum of probabilities over all topics.
So each term in the summation is the same kind of probability, as calculated in numerator. But in numerator it is for a specific topic 'j'. In denominator, it is the sum of such a probability for all the topics (1,...k), conditioned on the given document ""d"" and word ""w"".
So ensures that 
\sum_k{p(z_{d,w} = k)} = 1

1749	post_1386	E-Step Equation Explanation	Can anyone explain what is happening in the denominator? The notation is confusing and I don't feel it is explained in a very straightforward way	There is one thing may be confusing about p(z d,w=k) is that when I tried to calculate this p, I thought the words that are not in the document should be zero. However, the truth is p(z d,w=k) will store the probability for every vocabulary word for every document, because in the M-step, the c(w,d) will make the probability of words not in this document zero. And this is why the dimension of p(z d,w=k)  is (n = # of docs, k = # of topics, v = # of vocabulary).

Now there are two words with prob A and B. The catch here is to think BOTH the words as a single group (since they have to come from the same topic model) - hence combined probability of them as a group would be A*B (irrespective of the topic).

So based on my understanding, the shape for the nominator matrix should be (1000, 6) * (1000, 2, 6), which leads to the matrix of shape (1000, 2, 6). How do we suppose to reduce the dimension to (2, 6) by dividing the sum of each array row? The final matrix I get is of shape (1000, 2, 6) which doesn't fit the required dimension."	similar to how you did step E, now you're just going backward ! can think of step M as the reverse of step E to some degree I think. You can use the  np.einsum() function to help here. it's really simple ... just keep track of the dimensions with that function . good luck . otherwise the other option is to reslice and do it manually. from personal experience ... numpy is your best friend in data science ..

"This is the general formula for EM algo... you're better off looking specifically at the PLSA implementation of it. 
In here we can see that D is just the pi aspect of the function, and T is the p(theta) aspect of the formulas for E and M step... I.e for E step you need T and D and for M step you need Z generated from T and D + c(w,d)"

I believe I have my einsum and updating of the parameters correct, but I an't figure out how to fit in the term_doc_matrix.	"you're on the right path if you're using einsum in M step as well ! the term_doc_matrix is the c(w,d) so you have to use it with the Z(topic_prob) matrix. Recall what the M step is doing.
notice how c(w,d) is in the p(w|z) and P(z|d) .
If you used einsum in step E , think about how you used those dimensions to map to each other now just do the reverse ! note that the dimensions for all these matrix all share three terms : #of topics, #of vocab, #of documents. These will help out . Good luck"

I have made self.likelihoods as a list of log-likelihood values from each iteration, this value should be increasing and should be converging.  2 consecutive iteration value can be compared to check if the difference is less than epsilon and if so can be considered as the converge point and stop further iteration.

Human mind can hold 2D matrix multiplications - 3D is a stretch :-) Between easy but a bit longer; and complicated and shorter - I would suggest go with longer (loops) unless the easier version is very performance heavy- especially when the concept is new to you. what you lose in line brevity would be gained multiples times in clarity.

I can understand why it could be a tie. but that was my initially thought"	"The answer to Q4: ""k-NN only computes for each data which one is its nearest neighbor and there is no weights to estimate.""  I.e., no higher (lower) weight for a data point that is closer (farther) to signify influence.
Slide 6 in 11-1 recording states, ""Can be improved by considering the distance of a neighbor (a closer neighbor has more influence"" I guess this ""improvement"" is not a part of the core KNN"

But what I understood is those links/papers are for your references only. You can search more stuff on internet, cite them as references and then put all your review thoughts on that technology on your technology review paper. More research you will do deeper understanding you will have on the technology to review.

"I believe success only means that your code is able to execute without any issues. so when you get a 0 on the leaderboard, it probably means that your code does not meet the grading criteria and did not pass any test cases due to which it gives you a 0 irrespective of the fact of the grader output of success.
It would be best if you get it to clarify with the TAs."

"I can't speak to best practices for choosing appropriate kernels (just cross-validation maybe?) but kernelized SVM is absolutely a thing, you can see kernel arguments in popular implementations like sklearn
there is also a way to modify the SVM objective function to allow for misclassifications. basically instead of a ""hard"" margin, you can have a ""soft"" margin that allow some points to be on the wrong side of the decision boundary, with a penalty increasing with the size of the distance."

Naive Bayes Classifier is considered generative, and yet its general form, Logistic Regression, is considered discriminative. How can this be? I'd expect them to both be of the same class.
Also, in Week 10, discriminative classifiers are described as learning what features separate categories. How does Logistic Regression accomplish this?"	I think the difference between discriminative classifiers and generative classifiers is that discriminative classifiers try to model p(Y|X) directly while generative classifiers try to model  p(Y, X) first.

Recall = TP/(TP+FN) = count of y(+)/ (count of y(+) + count of n(+)) = 7/(7+1) = 7/8"
1928	post_1557	Micro Average (Practice Q11)	Can anyone explain how this micro average is created? I can't follow it even from the lecture without a clear example	For micro - averaging, you look at all the values from all categories & docs to calculate P & R. This contrasts with macro - averaging, where you would aggregate over either all of the docs or all of the categories (but not both). The formulas for P & R are the same, but for micro - averaging, you look at all the values in the table

P(θ2|d3) = p(d3|θ2) / ( p(d3|θ1)+ p(d3|θ2) ) = (2/10 * 2/ 10) / ( (1/10 * 3/ 10) + (2/10 * 2/ 10) ) = 4/7

However, in previous learning, we usually use word counts for Maximum Likelihood which will be 
wordcount(Spam)/wordcount(all)
wordcount(Spam)/wordcount(all)

I chose 1/3 since there are three data points (d1, d2, and d3) and only one of them (d1) is spam.

2006	post_1630	"Tech Review ""Overdue"" in grades"	If I am in the 3 credit-hour section of this course should I be seeing 'overdue' on the tech review submission? Or am I supposed to ignore it?	This is a pass/fail assignment, think it's fine as long as you submitted prior to the due date.

is there  template that we can use for writing the progress report for the course project?"	"I think you have to write about progress made, remaining tasks, any challenges/issues being faced, etc. The grading is based only on completion not on what you have mentioned. Therefore, you can use your judgement what to include. Please see below information from coursera

2016	post_1633	Progress Report Template	"Hi,

I do not see any problem on this approach as long as your dataset is big enough to perform sentiment analysis but check with TA and mention this in your progress report

The fees depend on the time of exams, for CS410, each exam costs $16. One of my other courses cost $22 for each exam causes it takes 2 hours to finish the exam. For on-campus students, I think the ProctorU fees are already covered by their tuitions.
