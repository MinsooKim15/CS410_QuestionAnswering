Those of you who have used Piazza will find Campuswire to be essentially similar to Piazza.  We will use Campuswire for all the  announcements and discussions of issues related to the class. It also serves as the major platform for question answering. So please make sure that you are regularly on Campuswire. For important announcements posted on Campuswire, we will also send you an email notification.\nI have eight excellent TAs to assist me in teaching this online class. They are:\n1. Assma Boughoula  (Head TA, boughou1@illinois.edu)\n2. Kevin Ros (Special TA: Infrastructure Coordinator, kjros2@illinois.edu)\n3. Yuxiang Liu (yuxiang@illinois.edu)\n4. Richa Meherwal (meherwa2@illinois.edu)\n5. Junting Wang (junting3@illinois.edu)\n6. Ziyuan Wei (ziyuan3@illinois.edu)\n7. Yuchen Yan (yucheny5@illinois.edu)\n8. Yunan Zhang (yunanz2@illinois.edu)\nI want to use this opportunity to thank all of them for serving as the TAs for this class. Special thanks to Assma for serving as the Head TA to coordinate all the TA work and to Kevin as our Special TA for taking care of two key infrastructures for supporting programming assignments and course projects!\nThis is our first post on Campuswire. We will post more information about the course here soon. Meanwhile, please feel free to post any questions that you may have here and we will do our best to answer your questions as soon as we can.  We believe that collaborative learning is powerful and beneficial, so we strongly encourage all of you to share your expertise and help answer questions from each other if you can.\nHope you will enjoy this online class. The TAs and I  are looking forward to working with all of you!\nThanks,\nChengXiang (\"Cheng\") Zhai, Instructor of CS410\nEmail: czhai@illinois.edu", "title": "Welcome to CS410!", "inLinkId": "", "replyList": [], "likeCount": "32", "commentCount": "8", "viewCount": "2229", "uniqueViewCount": "475"}, {"id": "post_5", "category": "post", "userName": "David Newman", "userType": 2, "content": "Hi everyone.

Think about what we humans could (further) infer from this sentence.

In order for a computer to fully understand the meaning of \"own\", the computer also needs to acquire a lot of common sense knowledge. So in sum, the point made here is that the deep understanding of meanings in natural language text is almost inseparable from possessing a lot of common sense knowledge.

How is this decided? I believe it is nothing more than a commonly agreed protocol.\nI found one interesting logic related to biostats : That's a matter of taste. A doubling (or the reduction to 50%) is often considered as a biologically relevant change. On the log2 scale this translates to one unit (+1 or -1). That's a simple value, easy to recall, and it is more \"fine grained\" than using higher bases (like log10). A doubling on the log10 scale translates to a change of \"just\" 0.3. Further, it is relatively simple to project the fold-changes. Most peopple have less problems to calculate 2^4.3 in their heads than e^3 (both is roughly 20-fold). And, finally, computer people (like bioinformaticians) are used to use base 2 because of the binary representation of information in EDP.\nThere is NO MATHEMATICAL reason to prefer any particular base.\nSource : https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_do_we_usually_use_Log2_when_normalizing_the_expression_of_genes", "inLinkId": "", "upvote": 0, "replyType": 0, "subReplyList": []}, {"id": "92d9208f64f8c8e9aa4fc82896a6c5b3", "userName": "peter zhang", "userType": 2, "content": "See this page.

Once a document is parsed, the system needs to decide if the number of generated tuples (<term-id,doc-id, term freq>), are enough or more document can be parsed. This is based on the amount of RAM allocated to the sorting system. Other way of design can be that Document parser/tokenizer is a different system and the tuples  (<term-id,doc-id, term freq>), created by tokenizer are streamed. The sorting system (with its limited memory), will load just enough tuples (as the available capacity of RAM).\nStep 2: Local sorting (based on TermId) happens for the currently loaded tuples. These tuples can belong to only one document or 5 documents or 100 documents, depending upon the RAM. Also, these tuples are already sorted based on DocID (since the parsing/tokenizing system is reading them in sequential order). Once the local sorting is done, the sorted tuples are written back to disk as \"temp\" files. This is what we see as \"solid\" line in \"local\" sort step in figure above.\nThis should clarify the question:  \"why isn't <1,5,3>,<1,6,2> or any of the other term-ids '1' coupled together in the 1st box?\". Simply, because, the RAM of \"local\" sorting system, is only loading tuples from few few of the documents, at a time.\nStep 3: Finally when all the tuples from all documents are sorted in step 2 and lots of temp files are created on disk, the \"external\" merge sort happens. We can read about external merge sort here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting\nTo your other question, about term frequency, I am not sure if I am looking at it correctly. Because, to me they look good. For example 1st tuple <1,1,3> is present correctly in last \"merge sort\" step also. Same goes for tuples like <1,2,2> , <1,6,3>.

You can easily build one with Whoosh. But it is merely the first step. There are also a lot of other works that need to be done to evaluate the usefulness/relevance/credibility/... of the documents.\nMany new techs use some language models to vectorize both the query and documents and calculate their similarities. The advantage of this approach is that it relies more on the meaning of words. Sometimes a document may not contain the query but it can still be very relevant. There are still some search engine tools, like Weaviate, supporting this function.\nOne latest but significant improvement that I know is that Google implemented BERT in their search. The search query may not be a simple phrase, and it can be some long sentence that involves pronouns or even complicated grammar, and it used to be the parser's job to understand the query and summarizes the query with some key phrases and weights. BERT turns to do a better job of understanding complicated queries.

It mostly depends on the TR system that is being developed and the targeted users. For example, Google would want to evaluate for both types of queries and make their TR engine very general to favor recall, whereas Amazon would mostly get very specific queries and would want a very precise system.\nHowever, evaluating different types of query intents is another problem altogether. In the Cranfield methodology, the people who design the queries, also assign relevance scores to the documents. As you correctly pointed out, this set of people could have different notions of \"relevancy\". Eg Google Scholar, for a query like Information Retrieval, some users could consider the oldest paper as more relevant, while some would want a recent survey paper. So if we use a single relevance scale, different users might want to give different relevance scores to a document.\nThere could be multiple ways of dealing with this problem. For each query-document pair, the relevance score can be assigned based on some aggregation (avg/median score by all users). Or you could design your query set in a way that covers all kinds of user intents. Another way would be to simulate different types of query responses by tweaking your system/model parameters and testing against the same query set. These are all very resource-intensive methods, and commercial IR systems tend to rely more on auxiliary features like filters/facets/sort-by-X to handle different user intents.", "inLinkId": "", "upvote": 0, "replyType": 0, "subReplyList": [{"id": "d22cb219599174397df5eb979441773d", "userName": "Kurt Tuohy", "userType": 2, "content": "Thank you!

Analyzing the click-through rates for suggestions will help inform the system on which TR system is best suited for that type of user.

Digestion here means that you are able to make sense of everything said in every lecture. You are not expected to know anything beyond what is covered in the lectures. Thus if a lecture only mentioned a concept X without much elaboration, you would not be expected to know about X in detail. The questions in both exams are all multi-choice questions. They will be very similar to those in the quizzes that you have been working on, but the concepts covered in the exams could potentially be from any lecture.\nThus, the best way to prepare for an exam is to make sure that you have watched and digested ALL the lecture videos. I emphasized “ALL” because I have noticed that some students have the tendency to use quizzes and MPs as a “roadmap” to selectively watch only those lecture videos related to quizzes or MPs instead of systematically watching all of them. If you are such a student, now it is a good opportunity for you to systematically review all the lectures so that you don’t leave any “hole” in the materials that we have covered; If you skip any of them, there would be a non-zero chance that you would lose points on very simple questions covered in that lecture.\nHere’s what I recommend:\nStep 1: Review all the lectures\nIf you have already watched every lecture video in all the weeks so far, you can now simply browse the lecture slides to review all the concepts. You may consider using the EducationalWeb learning platform as it provides a convenient way to both sequentially browse all the slides and navigate into related slides (back and forth) as needed. (It currently only works on Chrome.) You can also watch the corresponding lecture video with just one click or use its explanation function to jump from any slide directly to the relevant part of the textbook. To use EducationalWeb, visit http://educationalweb.web.illinois.edu, or simply use the “Download” drop-down menu on a Coursera lecture video page and then select “Slides on EducationalWeb”. If you encounter any part that seems hard to understand, you should then watch the corresponding lecture video and possibly also the related lectures to that lecture video since there is often dependency between them.\nIf you have once left some lecture videos or some part of a lecture unwatched or undigested, you should now systematically watch those parts, possibly also the related lectures before that point since sometimes the challenge in understanding a concept X is in fact due to not fully understanding a pre-requisite concept Y covered in an earlier lecture. Again, you may also use EducationalWeb especially if you want to mix watching lecture videos with browsing the slides. To use EducationalWeb (which currently only works on Chrome), visit http://educationalweb.web.illinois.edu, or simply use the “Download” drop-down menu on a Coursera lecture video page and then select “Slides on EducationalWeb”.\nStep 2: Review all the quiz questions\nThe exams are also meant to verify that by now you have fully mastered the concepts covered in the test quizzes. As such, some questions in the exams may be even identical to those you have seen in a quiz. Thus after you finish reviewing all the lectures, you should go over all the questions in those quizzes and check whether you are now able to answer every question confidently. Try to use a quiz as a “simulated exam” (i.e., answer all questions without looking up any material) to estimate how well you will likely do in the real exam. If you encounter any question that you are still a bit unsure about, go back to the lecture video/slides and review the corresponding concept.\nStep 3: Verify your understanding\nWe will provide you with a list of the specific topics to be covered in each exam to help you prepare for the exam. This list is meant to provide you a chance to “double check” whether you have indeed mastered all the lectures as we expect you to do. So after you have finished reviewing all the lectures and quiz questions, you can go over this list to reinforce your understanding of the most important concepts and also check whether there might still be any hole in your understanding. If so, go back to the corresponding lectures or slides.\nWe stress the importance of watching and digesting every lecture, so, DO NOT review the topic list BEFORE you finish reviewing all the lecture videos or slides.\n**\nGood Luck To You All!**", "title": "Advice on How to Prepare for the Exams", "inLinkId": "", "replyList": [], "likeCount": "30", "commentCount": "6", "viewCount": "2199", "uniqueViewCount": "426"}, {"id": "post_1030", "category": "post", "userName": "Seungill Kim", "userType": 2, "content": "Hi all,\nIf you are learning the lecture videos with the subtitle, you might be frustrated a lot. I am one of them. Unfortunately, the overall quality of the embedded subtitle is not good. If you feel uncomfortable, the attached subtitle correction will help. That includes the subtitle correction from week 1 to 6 that I found and fixed.\nSurprisingly, the number of errors I found is 575. That is more than 7% of the entire subtitle line. Some are trivial (e.g., they is -> they are), but many are misdelivering the meaning (e.g., the battle of wars -> the bag of words, query light holder -> query likelihood)\nI also signed up for the Coursera translator volunteer group to correct them. The lecture videos of the CS410 are also publicly opened as a Coursera course. The general public is watching lectures worldwide, and some of them will depend on the subtitle. So the poor quality of subtitles has the risk of delivering the wrong knowledge and degrading the overall quality and even reputation of the lecture. That is another reason to fix them immediately as well as help mates in the class.\nMoreover, that was for me a really interesting experience in text retrieval (guessing the correct(relevant) word under context). During word correction,\nI completely ignored the common(stop) word. That does not help to understand the context. They were more frustrating than expected. I wanted only ‘terms’ for guessing.\nRocchio is right. When guessing the correct word, I got to know the most probable clue is the neighborhood terms around the issue line. Terms in other chapters were not so relevant.\nThe error had a tendency. I could guess the expected workload and overall quality of the subtitle with the first two corrections in the lecture.\nAlthough I did not intend, my experience was an unexpected opportunity to understand the idea of text retrieval. I recommend you to try if interested. A dirty hand will give another aspect.\nTranscripts%20correction%20Week%201-6.zip", "title": "Lecture subtitle correction (week 1-6)", "inLinkId": "", "replyList": [{"id": "87419e1d0072cea9f0c77934bb987a67", "userName": "Otto Piramuthu", "userType": 2, "content": "Thanks for posting this.

Instead, with PLSA, you're assuming that there are X topics in your data, and you let the EM algorithm try to find the best parameters to increase overall system likelihood (this being an optimization problem).\nThe closest approach to ML I can see PLSA as is perhaps an unsupervised classification task, for which you don't need to split your data into test and training data, i.e. because the task is unsupervised, you don't have labels to test your data against (caveat: this of course depends on ML approach, and there are times when you might still want to have a test/train split in your data even for unsupervised tasks -- see a couple of discussions on this on stackoverflow, stackexchange, and quora).", "inLinkId": "", "upvote": 0, "replyType": 0, "subReplyList": []}], "likeCount": "4", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "297", "uniqueViewCount": "172"}, {"id": "post_1337", "category": "post", "userName": "Anonymous", "userType": 2, "content": "Anyone given up on MP3 yet? :)", "title": "Given up on MP3?", "inLinkId": "", "replyList": [{"id": "f210480153d0dd39fc0d65e921d7c4ec", "userName": "Ziyang Zhan", "userType": 2, "content": "I transferred from a business-related major.

If you don't recognize there's a normalization component inside step E and step M.. go review the notes first !\nTip#2 Debugging through this lab with an actual debug IDE and simply the test documents down to a really trivial example. Trust me when I say simplify the test text.. even with 1000 documents.. our human brains just can't comprehend that many words nor make sense of the data... There are two ways to solve this problem ... 1. make a visualization of all the text data or 2. make a super trivial example that's even more trivial than the test data.. (like 3 documents in the collections with 4 words or something) .. that way when you're debugging each component.. you can look and see each function working properly. There's a lot of functions in this lab.. so please make sure each function is returning as expected before you even move on to the next step.\nTip#3 the most confusing part is the formulas within step E and step M, refer to the post https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1354 . Mr Song has provided an excellent function that will simplify your nightmares, this is probably the biggest key to solving the lab..  i.e np.einsum() function will solve your lab.. if you don't even know what you're doing with this function.. my suggestion is to write out the dimensions of the matrices (all of the 3 matrices that we're supposed to basically implement T,D,Z ~ refer to github ReadME for what these matrices are ~ hint the dimensions are lowkey given to you lol) and just map them back to each other..  I think this lab is hard because we all struggle to understand and visualize summation notions... Matrix notations are probably much easier to visualize.. if you're struggling take some time and redraw the formulas in matrix notions and just play around with the dimensions until you can map the matrices properly to each other. The function above will help you. Don't forget the normalization factors in both steps!\nTip#4 Similar to how a lot of people are struggling with the likelihood function and there's more than enough post detailing what the likelihood function.. Remember that each iteration should return one likelihood summed across words and documents. If you're like me and you're terrified of long notations... remember that matrix multiplication can be expressed as a sum and that should help you with some of the terms..  np.log will be useful in this case.\nSome useful mappings for the formulas between the base code and the formulas we see in the lecture\nself.topic_prob = p(zij = k) ~ it's a 3D matrix if you look in the code... slighlty confusing to imagine but for each document , you have a matrix that is the joint probability of the topic and the word ...\nself.topic_prob_word = p(w|theta)\nself.document_topic_prob = pi(d,j)\nself.term_doc_matrix = c(w,d)\nIt's 5 am and i hate myself for leaving this lab to the last minute... i need to make better decisions in my life.. but if i can figure it out.. so can you ! good luck and don't give up ! take it slow and you'll get there :)", "title": "Hints for MP3", "inLinkId": "", "replyList": [], "likeCount": "21", "commentCount": "5", "viewCount": "724", "uniqueViewCount": "216"}, {"id": "post_1417", "category": "post", "userName": "Anonymous", "userType": 2, "content": "don't know what I am doing wrong, any help?", "title": "MP3 Success but 0 on leader board", "inLinkId": "", "replyList": [{"id": "85be4a15da9b42668a897366dcc67868", "userName": "Thomas Cheal", "userType": 2, "content": "my likelihoods were closer to -1700 so I would suggest there is an error somewhere in your code causing a lower score.", "inLinkId": "", "upvote": 0, "replyType": 0, "subReplyList": []}], "likeCount": "1", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "455", "uniqueViewCount": "197"}, {"id": "post_1419", "category": "post", "userName": "Anonymous", "userType": 2, "content": "Can we please get an extension on mp3?

The k value tells you the number of nodes you should consider as neighbours. If k = 1 you are looking for just one node closest to you - closest means most similar. The question actually simplifies the \"similarity logic\" by providing a score between two nodes indicating how similar they are. So for D6, you just pick up the highest score (thus highest similarity) for k=1. D1 is that node (you look at the column/row title, and the score is similarity between the column/row titled node). now, you just look at the label D1 has - since D6 would belong to the same group.\nIn another question you would find a different value of k. there you are looking for different number of neighbours and trying to look at their labels, and that complicates the question a little bit.

Instead, the best way to use this list (which should also enable you to benefit most from this list) is to review this list AFTER you have finished reviewing all the lectures and quiz questions as a way to reinforce your understanding of the most important concepts and also check whether there might still be any hole in your understanding. If you have difficulty in understanding any concept/topic, go back to the corresponding lectures/slides, or post questions on Campuswire, or visit our office hours.\nEnjoy the rest of the break and good luck on Exam 2!\nThanks,\n-Cheng", "title": "Topics to be covered in Exam 2", "inLinkId": "", "replyList": [], "likeCount": "6", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "62", "uniqueViewCount": "40"}]
